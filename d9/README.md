For visualization run with " python logic -v *borader_size*" borader_size is optional (default = 15)

**note:** this **WILL** eventually go out-of-bounds since I did not bother to transpose out of bounds positions to origin, but its fun to see how the rope moves / use it for debugging. If you really want to see the whole thing feel free to fix it :p
