# AoC2022

These are my **own** solutions to the puzzles of AoC (Advent of Code) 2022.

Feel free to use them as reference if you are stuck.

Structure:

    - New directory for each day containing:

        - logic.py: the solution

        - input.txt: the input of the puzzle
        
        - inst: the instructions for both parts
